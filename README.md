# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Description

I completed this task as part of the 04 challenge for Web APIs. This site will allow you to take a 10 question multiple choice quiz on the fundamentals of javascript. There will be a 60 second timer and you have the ability to save your high score and initials to the local storage. You can also access the high scores at any time on the website. Every question you get wrong will deduct 5 seconds from the timer. Coding this project really helped me understand the basic Web API functions and it makes me more excited to see what I am able to do with 3rd Party API's.
